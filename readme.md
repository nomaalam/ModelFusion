# ModelFusion

ModelFusion is an interactive Streamlit web application for exploring and comparing multiple classification models on your own datasets. Upload a CSV, select features and target, tune model hyperparameters, perform feature selection, visualize decision boundaries, and evaluate model performance—all in one place.

## Features

- **Upload CSV**: Easily upload your dataset for analysis.
- **Feature & Target Selection**: Choose which columns to use as features and target.
- **Feature Selection**: Optionally select the top K features using ANOVA F-value.
- **Preprocessing**: Automatic encoding of categorical variables and feature scaling.
- **Model Selection**: Choose from KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Adjust key hyperparameters for each model via the sidebar.
- **Model Evaluation**: View classification reports, F1 scores, and confusion matrices.
- **Decision Boundary Visualization**: Visualize decision boundaries for models with 2 features.
- **Cross-Validation**: Run 5-fold cross-validation and see average F1 scores.
